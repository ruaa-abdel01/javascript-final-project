    <h1>The Cottage Garden</h1>
     <p>The <span>cottage garden </span>is a distinct style of 
        garden that uses an informal design, dense planting and a mixture 
        of ornamental and edible plants.</p>
     <p>The Cottage Garden originated in <span>
     <a href="">England</a></span> and its history can be traced back 
     for centuries, although they were re-invented in 1870's England, 
     when stylized versions were formed as a reaction to the more 
     structured and rigorously maintained  <span> 
     <a href="">  English estate gardens</a></span>.</p>

     <p>The earliest cottage gardens were more practical than their 
     modern descendants, with an emphasis on vegetables and herbs, 
     along with some fruit trees.</p>
