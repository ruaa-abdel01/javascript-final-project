    <h1>Understanding Quotations</h1>

    <h2>Blockquotes</h2>
    <p>The <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element is used for longer quotes
    that take up an entire paragraph. Note how the <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>
    element is still used inside the <code>&lt;blockquote&gt;</code> element.</p>
    
    <blockquote cite="https://www.een.wikipedia.org/wiki/Winnie_the_Pooh">
        <p>Did you ever stop to think, and forget to start again?</p>
    </blockquote>
        <p>As A.A. Milne said, <q>Some people talk to animals.
        Not many listen though. That's the problem.</q></p>

    <h2>Short Quotes</h2>
    <p>The <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element is used for shorter quotes that sit 
    within a paragraph. Browsers are supposed to put quotes around the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code>
    element, however Internet Explorer does not-therefore many people avoid using 
    the <code>&lt;q&gt;</code> element.</p>
