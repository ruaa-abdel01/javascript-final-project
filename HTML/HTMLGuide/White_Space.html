        <p>White space in HTML refers to any space, tab, or newline character 
            that is used to separate elements in the code. It is important for 
            readability and does not affect the rendering of the page.</p>

        <p>In order to make code easier to read, web page authors often
        add extra spaces or start some elements on new lines.</p>

        <p>When the browser comes across two or more spaces next to each other
        it will only display one space. Similarily if it comes across a line break,
        it treats it as a single space. Thi is known as <b>white space collapsing </b>.</p>
